# Add to Vercel environment
SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

// Options: proxy-search, direct-search, search-real
const response = await fetch('/api/demo-search', {
```

2. **Add environment variables** in Vercel dashboard for proxy services

3. **Deploy and test**

## Natural Language Processing

The application parses natural language queries to extract:

- **Location**: "in Paris", "near Tokyo", "at New York"
- **Guest Count**: "for 2 guests", "4 people", "3 adults"
- **Price Range**: "under $100", "max $200", "between $50-150"
- **Dates**: "from July 1st", "check-in June 15th"
- **Special Requirements**: "pet-friendly", "with kitchen", "has pool"

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/search-real` - Main search endpoint that processes natural language queries
- Query parameters: `location`, `checkin`, `checkout`, `adults`, `children`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`
